# Hopper Filter

This simple Spigot/Bukkit plugin adds vanilla-style hopper filters! Simply place an item frame on your hopper, and put an item in. By default the filter is `inclusive` meaning that it allows through only the item in the frame. Right click it to invert it so it will block specifically that item. Put multiple item frames on different faces of the hopper for multiple filters!

Example usage: 3 item frames on hopper: diamond, diamond block, diamond ore. Diamond chest is sorted from rest of your items with just one hopper and 3 item frames :)
